Most of them were made for fun, but a few of them eventually ended up being useful to me and a few other people.

Even though all I like all of the projects I've made, I've ordered them based on their relevance to my current goals:

* [torch-dreams](https://github.com/Mayukhdeb/torch-dreams) + [rover](https://github.com/Mayukhdeb/rover)
* [devolearn](https://github.com/DevoLearn/devolearn)
* [differentiable-morphogenesis](https://github.com/Mayukhdeb/differentiable-morphogenesis)
* [RAFT-opticalflow-runwayML](https://github.com/Mayukhdeb/RAFT-opticalflow-runwayML)
* [patrick](https://github.com/Mayukhdeb/patrick)

Hackathon projects:

* [student-sight](https://devpost.com/software/student-sight)
* [AgroAssist](https://github.com/sanjay-thiyagarajan/AgroAssist)

Older, more rudimentary projects:

* [mind_the_bend](https://github.com/Mayukhdeb/mind_the_bend)
* [deep-chicken-terminator](https://github.com/Mayukhdeb/deep-chicken-terminator)
* [deep-chicken-saviour](https://github.com/Mayukhdeb/deep-chicken-saviour)
* [gradient-games](https://github.com/Mayukhdeb/gradient-games)

Since you made it this far, here's a tree I made on matplotlib on a loss landscape:
