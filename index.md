🔍 As of late I'm trying to explain and understand how large neural nets work at [Aleph-Alpha](https://aleph-alpha.de/).

🎨 I'm also building [eden](https://github.com/abraham-ai/eden), a sandbox for [abraham.ai](https://abraham.ai/) to create generative art with machine learning. I've spent some time in the past trying to reverse engineer vision models which eventually led to [torch-dreams](https://github.com/Mayukhdeb/torch-dreams). 

🔬 I've worked with  [INCF](https://incf.org/)/[OpenWorm](http://openworm.org/) during [Google Summer of Code 2020](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/archive/2020/projects/5694589333143552/) to build [devolearn](https://github.com/DevoLearn/devolearn), a set of deep-learning based tools to help accelerate research in developmental biology.

🛠️ I've also been an intern at [RunwayML](https://runwayml.com/) where we worked on building next-gen video tools with deep-learning. 

📘 Here's my [blog](https://mayukhdeb.github.io/blog/), [CV](https://mayukhdeb.github.io/cv.pdf) and a bunch of [other projects](/projects).
