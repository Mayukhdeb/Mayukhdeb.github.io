As of late I spend my time trying to reverse engineer neural networks to to figure out ways to fool them. This has eventually led to [torch-dreams](https://github.com/Mayukhdeb/torch-dreams)

I've worked with  [INCF](https://incf.org/)/[OpenWorm](http://openworm.org/) during [Google Summer of Code 2020](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/archive/2020/projects/5694589333143552/) to build [devolearn](https://github.com/DevoLearn/devolearn), a set of deep-learning based tools to help accelerate research in developmental biology.

I've also been an intern at [RunwayML](https://runwayml.com/) where we worked on building next-gen video tools with deep-learning. 

Here's my [blog](https://mayukhdeb.github.io/blog/), [CV](https://mayukhdeb.github.io/cv.pdf) and a bunch of [other projects](/projects).
