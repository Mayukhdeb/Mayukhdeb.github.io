						<p>As of now I balanced the lefts and rights by mirroring the images and adding them to the training set with reversed steering values. </p>

						<p>Planned: balance the dataset with augmentation. And also collect a lot more training data </p>

						<h3>The idea was to work on a clean dataset to improve my understanding of deep learning models.</h3>

						<p>
							The clean dataset gave me time to work on and experiment with stuff like implementing validation sets, batch normalization and dropout layers.

							I'm not proud of it, but hey it works fine for me.
						</p>
						<a><img src="images/poor.png" width = "40%"  img-align= "middle" /></a>
						<p> And after all the tweaking and experimentation, I got an accuracy of 91.8%.<br>
						 Which is not bad at all considering the fact that the  model was trained locally.</p>

							<p>The trained model reliably predicts between "alpha" and "beta". It was trained on web scraped images. The inputs given were "car" and "dog"</p>
							<p>The idea was simple, to automate the collection and preprocessing of data for simple deep learning models.</p>
							<p>All that the user does is to type in two key words like "bear" and "potato". The rest is taken care of, from collecting data from google image searches to converting them into labeled arrays and training the model. </p>

							<h2>So what did I learn about myself ?</h2>
							<p>The most important thing that I found about myself is that I need to get out of my comfort zone more often to get certain things done. I barely knew anything about HTML5 and CSS. But now apart from the regular python stuff, I want to devote some time to learn more about how webpages work as well.  </p>
							<p>In the last week, I also realised that reverse engineering programs to find the "inverse element" is more fun than I thought. I genuinely enjoyed trying to reverse the "reverse_me.py", it felt more like a puzzle than a "task" to me.  </p>

									<h3>The Hackerrank tasks</h3>
									<p>I found the "Diagonal difference" problem quite interesting. The tricky part was to extract the diagonals of an "n x n" array instead of an array with given dimensions. In fact I had to use a copy and a pen to finally figure it out. </p>

									<h3>The Codeforces tasks</h3>
									<p>The "bit++" problem really got me thinking, it was fun to think of it as a new programming language. It's amazing how we can make a simplified version of a programming language by defining functions within the "non simple" language itself. </p>

									<h3>"Failures"</h3>
									
									<p>Like every other learning process, I've failed here too. But that's the point isn't it, we learn only after we fail. I tried "google scraping using ruby", but failed. I'll try and learn a bit more of ruby before I try it again. Until then, I'm happy that I tried to do something new.</p>

									<h3>Beyond pre-amFOSS tasks</h3>
									<p>The only "not bad" personal project I made is a simple  NN model that makes the truck in "Euro Truck Simulator" steer correctly by itself. The NN is based on "alexnet", the rest of the "data management" part is the result of intense googling, but at least it's made by me. I'm planning to make a NN of my own from scratch for this project after I get a better hang of PytTorch.  </p>

									<h3>Other stuff I'm working on</h3>
									<p>Collected Facial data of my friends (using my webcam) and saved them as numpy arrays paired with "vectors" which will later help identify which array refers to which friend. Will feed this data to a NN which I'll try and make using PyTorch. As of now I'm collecting all sorts of raw data and molding them to be NN friendly, like I've also collected and molded some data based on the occurrences of all earthquakes since 2150 B.C (latitude, longitude, richter scale, region code)</p>
