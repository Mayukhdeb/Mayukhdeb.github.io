							<h2>The last week with pre-amFOSS</h2>
							<p>The last week was a chance for me to learn all sorts of new stuff and to try to complete the rest of the tasks. The very fact the we were in the lab instead of being in our respective rooms somehow encouraged us to do more. </p>
							<p>The first thing that I did was to install ubuntu, the installation was "almost" a breeze. But whenever I faced issues, my mentor Vibhoothi bhaiya helped me out.  </p>
							<p>The "regex using rust" was quite a hurdle for me, because I had to install and learn the language all from scratch. Our mentor used to push all of us to do this task from the very beginning since it was "easy", but the task was just "logically easy" for me. Because Rust looked nothing like python. Cue googling about rust almost all night, from taking inputs to assigning variables, everything was different. </p>
							<ul class="actions stacked">
								<li><a href="https://github.com/Mayukhdeb/amfoss-tasks/tree/final/final/task%207" class="button">Regex using rust</a></li>
							</ul>
							<p>What I found great about rust were the error messages, they were way better than the ones in python. God bless the person who thought of giving "help: there is a method with a similar name " as a part of the  error messages</p>
						</div>
						<div class="inner">
							<h2>And one more thing I tried</h2>
							<p>The last two days on the train were definitely not the best I've had lately. 
								Thanks to no internet and the baby which kept crying through the day.
								
								I found my solace in the  "reverse_me.py" problem.
								 </p>
							
							<ul class="actions stacked">
							
							<center> <img src="images/woop.png" width = "75%"  img-align= "middle" /> </center>
								<li><a href="https://github.com/Mayukhdeb/amfoss-tasks/tree/final/final/bonus%20task/reverse_me_reversed" class="button">reversed_2.py + light explanation </a></li>
							</ul>
							<p>To the left(converted to 3.5 raw - Copy.py)  is a slightly modified version of the original code reverse_me.py 
								( modifications -- converted syntax to python 3.5 , removed the if statement in the end to check for the correct answer.)
								
								The modified code just shows us the encrypted version of the characters we entered 
								
								and it also shows the state of the characters through various stages (nevermind the odd names I gave to the stages).
								
								To the right(reverse.py) is quite possibly the "inverse" of the one to the left. 
							</p>
							<p>
								As you can see, I first entered "abcde123" to the left,
								
								which was then converted to a hash like thingy.
								
								I then copy-pasted the hash like thingy to my own reverse.py  and let it do its job.
								
								And voila ! I got the same string, but as characters in an array.
							
								
						
							</p>
							<p>Do notice that the  intermediate stages of the message through the different stages of encryption and the decryption are the same , but in reverse order of course. Further justifying the fact that it (kind of) works.
							   The "array_entering_xor" to the left is the same as "UN-XORed array" to the right in reversed.py.
							   The "string form" is also the same for both.
							</p>
							<p>How I reversed each function is a long story, I'll write all about it very soon, after reverse.py actually decodes the message without any errors halfway down the original message. 

									"reverse.py" is still a work in progress, I'm still trying to figure out a way through the errors. 
									Hopefully I can make it work  within the next few days. 
							</p>
							<h2>Update on reverse_me.py</h2>

							<center> <img src="images/mario.png" width = "75%"  img-align= "middle" /> </center>
							<p>I had a stupid little logical error going on in the early part of the decryption process, will elaborate on it in the readme soon enough. But as of now, "reversed_2.py" has successfullty decrypted the first 6 characters of the message. I think I'm pretty close to figuring this out. </p>

							<h2>So what did I learn about myself ?</h2>
							<p>The most important thing that I found about myself is that I need to get out of my comfort zone more often to get certain things done. I barely knew anything about HTML5 and CSS. But now apart from the regular python stuff, I want to devote some time to learn more about how webpages work as well.  </p>
							<p>In the last week, I also realised that reverse engineering programs to find the "inverse element" is more fun than I thought. I genuinely enjoyed trying to reverse the "reverse_me.py", it felt more like a puzzle than a "task" to me.  </p>

									<h3>The Hackerrank tasks</h3>
									<p>I found the "Diagonal difference" problem quite interesting. The tricky part was to extract the diagonals of an "n x n" array instead of an array with given dimensions. In fact I had to use a copy and a pen to finally figure it out. </p>

									<h3>The Codeforces tasks</h3>
									<p>The "bit++" problem really got me thinking, it was fun to think of it as a new programming language. It's amazing how we can make a simplified version of a programming language by defining functions within the "non simple" language itself. </p>

									<h3>"Failures"</h3>
									
									<p>Like every other learning process, I've failed here too. But that's the point isn't it, we learn only after we fail. I tried "google scraping using ruby", but failed. I'll try and learn a bit more of ruby before I try it again. Until then, I'm happy that I tried to do something new.</p>

									<h3>Beyond pre-amFOSS tasks</h3>
									<p>The only "not bad" personal project I made is a simple  NN model that makes the truck in "Euro Truck Simulator" steer correctly by itself. The NN is based on "alexnet", the rest of the "data management" part is the result of intense googling, but at least it's made by me. I'm planning to make a NN of my own from scratch for this project after I get a better hang of PytTorch.  </p>

									<h3>Other stuff I'm working on</h3>
									<p>Collected Facial data of my friends (using my webcam) and saved them as numpy arrays paired with "vectors" which will later help identify which array refers to which friend. Will feed this data to a NN which I'll try and make using PyTorch. As of now I'm collecting all sorts of raw data and molding them to be NN friendly, like I've also collected and molded some data based on the occurrences of all earthquakes since 2150 B.C (latitude, longitude, richter scale, region code)</p>

						<h2>How will I contribute ?</h2>
						<p>The first thing that I'll do is that I'll advance myself in the fields I'm interested in, while learning something new in parallel. Something which I haven't tried before like Javascript. My main focus would be on machine learning and data science. And it's applications in real life, like (say) predicting how many students will come to the mess for dinner based on input data regarding the weekday, whether it's a holiday or not, time of the year, proximity to exams, and a lot more. But that would be one hell of a task to collect all that data. This was just an example of what could be done.</p>
						<p>As far as I've seen, collecting training data is generally the hard part. So I also want to use web scraping to make it a bit easier to extract training data from the internet.</p>
						<p>Learn, Apply and Create. That is what I want to do. </p>
